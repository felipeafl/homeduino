#summary Push button module overview

= Introduction =

The push button module is a module where push buttons can be connected to.  For every push button, there is a LED to provide user feedback ( light is on, light is off, etc ... )

= Details =

Progress:
 * Start off with regular debounce example

Connect buttons like this:
 * Arduino forum: example of using one analog pin to read 5 switches [http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1226896251/0]
 * put x numer of resistors in serie and each push button sorts a single resistor
   * if each resistor is x times the value of the previous, it should be possible to read each combination of buttons pushed.  ( Good value for x is 1.4678 witch matches with standard resistor values )

TODO:
 * find a way to autoconfigure modules
   * random generated mac
   * udp broadcast for config data
   * save config in nvram
 * Maximum number of leds that can be attached to a Atmega328 ?
